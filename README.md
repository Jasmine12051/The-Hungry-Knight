# The-Hungry-Knight
In the code, The Hungry Knight, I started off by importing the java.util.Scanner method. This gives me the ability to receive input from the user. After that I create different variables to hold various data that is gathered from the input of the user, such as their name, a characteristic about them, and the amount of each item they are buying. The code outputs a welcome message to the user introducing the place and welcoming the user. The next line of code gets the user's name and characteristic. I store each item that is entered by the user in a name variable and a characteristic variable. Next, the code asks the user how many plates the user wants of roast, reads the input, and stores the input into a roast variable. The code repeats the same steps with the beef stew, bread, and fruit. The code takes all of the inputs and multiplies them each by the amount they costs. It adds them all together and then stores it in a variable called sub-total. The code then uses the sub-total variable to calculate the tax. The sub-total is multiplied by 0.05 and the product is stored in a varaible called tax. The final total is then calculated. The code takes the sub-total and the tax and adds them together. The code stores the answer into a variable called final_total. Lastly, the code outputs the sub-total, the tax that the user has to pay, and the final price that the user owes.
